One day a lion passed that way and saw the four cows.The lion went near the cows.When the cows saw the lion coming near to them, all of them fought together against the lion.The Lion ran away.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>After some days, the cows quarrelled with each other and began to graze in different directions and all alone.This was noticed by the lion.
		The lion thought that its turn had come and came there.</strong></p>
